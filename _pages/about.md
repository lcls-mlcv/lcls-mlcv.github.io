Welcome to the Machine Learning and Computer Vision group (MLCV) in the Data Systems Division of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory!

We are a group of researchers and engineers working on developing and applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to the analysis of X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) data. Our mission is to enable the next generation of XFEL experiments by providing cutting-edge data analysis tools and techniques. We bring innovative solutions from our partners in academia and industry to the forefront of XFEL science.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in joining our group or collaborating on a project!
