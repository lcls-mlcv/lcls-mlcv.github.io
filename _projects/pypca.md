What is the rank of an LCLS experiment? Initial work to answer this question led to the development of a tool that allows to perform Principal Component Analysis on imaging dataset of arbitrary size (both pixel wise and time wise), thus opening the door to rapid featurization with potential for experiment steering. A bit more details in these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Quajphb9U3hLZu3w3XooOkExusXeE4lcX8sW4uZ7kJE/edit?usp=sharing).

*More details coming soon*
