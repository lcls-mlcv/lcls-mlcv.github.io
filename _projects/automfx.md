Xopt is the core optimization engine driving our group’s automation efforts in beamline alignment. It is a flexible, open-source Python framework designed for high-level optimization across simulations, experiments, and control systems. It allows users to define input variables, objectives and constraints through a simple “VOCS” interface, then select from advanced algorithmic generators (e.g., evolutionary, Bayesian, multi-objective, multi-fidelity) to drive optimization with minimal boilerplate.
