Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as the method of choice to characterize the structural variability of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. We present a reconstruction approach that eliminates the need for post-hoc atomic model fitting in 3D maps by deforming a given atomic model along its normal modes directly against the 2D data. See {% cite nashed2022heterogeneous %} for early results on synthetic data. *More soon!*
