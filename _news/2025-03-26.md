We had a great time at the [West Coast Structural Biology Workshop 2025](https://wcsbw2025.macromolecules.xyz/)! Co-organized by Mike Thompson (UC Merced), Alec Follmer (UC Davis)and Sandra Mous (LCLS), the workshop was a great success with more than 100 early-career participants.

We are looking forward to the next edition in 2027!
