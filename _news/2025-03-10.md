To wrap up the Winter quarter, we had a Journal Club on Statistical Crystallography, where Fred presented the paper ["Statistical crystallography reveals an allosteric network in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.28.635305.abstract) by TJ Lane and colleagues. It was a great opportunity to learn about allostery and the nascent field of statistical crystallography and to discuss the implications for what we do at LCLS.

This was the last meeting of the quarter, following amazing talks by Axel on ADP-3D, Louis on BayFAI, Nathan on PyPCA, as well as Jay on X-RAI!

We also learned a great deal from the students through the "Things I learned" segment introduced by Doris, where Doris told us about the Welford's algorithm, Nathan about Transformers, Louis about edge detection and Pierre-Louis about ray tracing!

Looking forward to the Spring quarter!
